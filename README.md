# Covid Info Healthcare Bot
#### Industry: Health
<br />

#### Problem Statement/Opportunity:
The number of calls to public health hotlines and patient communication networks is far higher than typical, putting a strain on existing resources. There is a great need for an easy-to-access and understood platform for individuals to be able to make informed decisions about their health. However, there is a lack of such an information platform as most of the health information available today is either not easily accessible or not easily understood by the average individual. On the basis of symptoms, it is difficult to conclude that the person has covid or not through normal screening. People are unsure of what steps to take to protect themselves and their families, and they have several concerns. Furthermore, COVID-19 rumours, misconceptions, and disinformation have spread as swiftly as the virus itself.

#### Project Description:
I have created a Chatbot to help the general public learn more about COVID-19 which collects automated screening protocols and self-checker algorithms from organizations implementing screening protocols in interactive web sites, chat bots, and other technology. The topics covered include basic information about COVID-19, transmission, testing, risk reduction and safety measures. By typing in queries, Covid Chatbot will guide users to search for relevant information that is tailored towards their query. The chatbot provides you with the necessary information to make better decisions that are unique to you. The Covid Chatbot will be the first line of communication between individuals and health professionals. It will provide an approachable way for individuals to obtain timely, accurate information on COVID-19 infection in order to better protect themselves and their loved ones. The chatbot's cognitive component consists of a module that analyses user queries and determines if relevant information needs to be searched for. Precise, targeted data is then retrieved from the database. The chatbot's knowledge base then processes these results into an easily understandable format for users. COVID-19 will be a great financial strain on our healthcare system. Chatbot will provide timely information to individuals and mitigate this financial burden by providing accurate information free of charge. It will also help to prevent infected individuals from visiting costly hospitals unnecessarily. The chatbot's reasoning component determines the most probable next steps to take based on user questions, its knowledge base, and information retrieved from its database. It draws inferences, filters out irrelevant data points over time, and overcomes biases by incorporating holistic considerations.
